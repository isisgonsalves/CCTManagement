HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: 

I began by reviewing the first 3 labs and lectures to grasp the concepts more.

This was my first "big" java program. With being a little nervous, 
I first read the assignment document, drew it out on paper to ensure I have a good understanding, and then finally made all my classes that was needed.

Then I started in order of the document and created all the variables, constructors and accessors for each class. 

From there, I began coding the methods in each class. 
This is when connections began and it all started coming together. 

There was minor details I had to research such as how to get the current date, how to traverse an array and how to compare dates. This was documented in the comments next to the code.

USER INSTRUCTIONS: The user simply has to compile the program and execute.
		  
		   To alter the amounts charged and cancelled, the user would need to open the CCTManagement class and 
		   1. add charges by writing cc.charge(desired amount).
		   2. to remove existing charges by deleting the line of code.
		   3. to make a cancellation by writing cc.cancel(desired transaction ID).
		   4. to remove existing cancellation by deleting the line of code. 

		   Then compile and execute to see results.
